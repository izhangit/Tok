## Pipeline Workflow

The project workflow consists of the following stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data is ingested from multiple sources using **Azure Data Factory**.
2. **Raw Data Storage**: Ingested data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** for scalability and security.
3. **Data Transformation**: Data is processed and transformed using **Azure Databricks**, enabling complex data engineering tasks.
4. **Transformed Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in a structured format in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.
5. **Analytics**: Transformed data is analyzed using **Azure Synapse Analytics** for advanced querying and big data insights.
6. **Visualization**: Insights are visualized with tools like **Power BI**, **Looker Studio**, and **Tableau**.
